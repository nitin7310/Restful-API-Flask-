        "\n",
        "Q1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for computer systems to communicate over the internet using standard web protocols like HTTP. It‚Äôs one of the most popular architectures for building web services because it‚Äôs simple, scalable, and flexible\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> What an API Specification Includes\n",
        "1. Endpoints: The URLs where the API can be accessed (e.g., /users, /products)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. HTTP Methods: What actions are allowed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Request Parameters: What data can or must be sent with a request\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Response Format: What kind of data the API returns (usually JSON or XML)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Authentication Rules: How users or systems must identify themselves\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Error Codes: What happens when something goes wrong\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "  ->> Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that‚Äôs widely used for building web applications and RESTful APIs. It‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmicro‚Äù framework because it provides the essentials‚Äîrouting, request handling, and templating‚Äîwithout enforcing a specific project structure or including built-in tools like authentication or database management\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> Routing in Flask is the mechanism that connects URLs to Python functions, allowing your web app to respond to different web requests. It‚Äôs how Flask knows what content to serve when someone visits a specific path like /home or /about.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> 1. Install Flask\n",
        "Make sure you have Python installed, then run\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create Your App File\n",
        "Create a file named app.py and add the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Run the App\n",
        "In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing app.py and run:\n",
        "\n",
        "Then open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ‚Äî you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúHello, Flask!‚Äù\n",

        "Q6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->>üß† Key Characteristics\n",
        "1. GET is safe and idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. POST is not idempotent‚Äîrepeating it may create multiple resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. PUT and DELETE are idempotent‚Äîrepeating them doesn‚Äôt change the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, depending on how it's implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to bind a URL path to a specific Python function, turning that function into a view that handles requests to that route. It‚Äôs the core mechanism for defining how your web app responds to different URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->>\n",
        "- GET is used to retrieve data from a server. It appends parameters directly to the URL, making the data visible in the browser‚Äôs address bar. This makes it less secure and suitable only for non-sensitive information. GET requests can be cached, bookmarked, and stored in browser history. However, they have limitations on the amount and type of data you can send.\n",
        "\n",
        "- POST is used to send data to a server, typically to create or update resources. It places the data in the body of the request, keeping it hidden from the URL. This makes POST more secure and capable of handling larger and more complex data, including binary files. POST requests are not cached or stored in browser history, and they cannot be bookmarked.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->>\n",
        "1. Use Flask‚Äôs @app.errorhandler Decorator\n",
        "You can define custom error handlers for specific HTTP status codes or exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Handle Unexpected Exceptions\n",
        "Catch all unhandled exceptions to prevent your app from crashing:\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Raise Custom Exceptions\n",
        "You can define your own exception classes for more control:\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use abort() for Quick Error Responses\n",
        "Flask‚Äôs abort() function lets you trigger an error manually:\n",

        "Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",

        "1. Install Required Packages\n",
        "\n",
        "pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy\n",
        "If you're using MySQL or PostgreSQL, you'll also need a connector like PyMySQL or psycopg2.\n",

        "\n",
        "  ->> Core Role of Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
        "- Integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask: It wraps SQLAlchemy‚Äôs powerful ORM (Object Relational Mapper) and configures it to work seamlessly with Flask‚Äôs app context2.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simplifies Database Operations: You can define models as Python classes and interact with the database using Python code instead of raw SQL3.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Supports Multiple Databases: Works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others‚Äîjust change the connection URI.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Manages Sessions and Transactions: Handles database sessions and commits automatically, reducing boilerplate code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provides Query API: Lets you perform CRUD operations with expressive Python syntax like User.query.filter_by(name='Alice').first().\n",

        "- Enables Migrations: Easily integrates with tools like Alembic to manage schema changes over time\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> A blueprint is an object that defines a set of operations (like routes and error handlers) that can be registered on a Flask application later. It‚Äôs not a standalone app, but a template for extending your main app\n",
        "\n",
        "@ Why Blueprints Are Useful\n",
        "- Modularity: Split your app into logical sections (e.g., users, posts, admin).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reusability: Reuse blueprints across multiple apps or projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability: Manage large apps more easily by isolating features.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maintainability: Keep code organized and easier to debug or extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Team Collaboration: Developers can work on separate blueprints without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes.\n",

        "Q13.What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> The purpose of Flask‚Äôs request object is to give you access to everything the client sends to your server during an HTTP request. It‚Äôs like a digital envelope containing all the details of the incoming message‚Äîheaders, form data, query parameters, cookies, files, and more\n",

        "\n",
        "Q18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> An API specification is a detailed blueprint that defines how an API behaves‚Äîwhat endpoints it exposes, what data it expects, how it responds, and how it handles errors. Think of it as a contract between the backend and the frontend (or any client), ensuring everyone knows exactly how to interact with the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "üß† How It Helps When Building a Flask API\n",
        "- Clarity for Developers: Everyone knows what to build and how to use it\n",

        "Q19.What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->> HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the outcome of a client‚Äôs request. In a Flask API, they play a crucial role in communicating whether a request was successful, failed, or needs further action.\n",
        "\n",
        "üß† Why They Matter in Flask APIs\n",
        "- Clear Communication: They tell the client exactly what happened‚Äîwhether the request was OK (200), created something (201), or failed (404, 500).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Error Handling: You can define custom responses for errors like 400 Bad Request or 403 Forbidden to guide users or developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Debugging & Logging: Status codes help developers pinpoint issues quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- RESTful Design: They align with REST principles by mapping HTTP methods to expected outcomes.\n",
